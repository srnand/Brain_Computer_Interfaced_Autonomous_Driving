# Brain_Computer_Interfaced_Autonomous_Driving
**Self-Driving Cars! No steering wheel, no manual control, no troubles.** 

Just like a human, these autonomous cars use sensor obtained data to understand the situations 
around them, and a brain that receives, processes on information gathered from ultrasound or LIDAR. 

Reinforcement learning algorithms have been applied in robotics to learn how to solve tasks based on reward signals obtained 
during task execution. In that, the basic mechanism involves providing a reward signal, reinforcement signal to the robot 
according to the actions performed. 

With the inclusion of that, more than just being safe and reliable, for user acceptance, such vehicles will also provide a 
rich user experience. Here, learning using BCI overpowers tedious and error-prone manual tuning of human dependent parameters. 
Brain-Computer Interface approach allows the user to just think about the desired style of driving, and the car will.

We have used DEAP Dataset for brain signal classification.
